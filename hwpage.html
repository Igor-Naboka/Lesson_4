        Space facts are always interesting to learn!
      </h3>

      <br>

      <p class="text">
        As time goes by, technological advancements have seen us learn more facts about space in <br> the past
        century than in all time before that.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p class="text">
        We’ve literally searched the universe for the most amazing space facts, including facts about the <br>
        planets in our solar system, moons, the Milky Way, and beyond! We’re pretty sure #15 will make <br> you smile!
      </p>

      <br>

      <p class="text">
        Before you begin your journey through time & space, check out our video below with our 5 favorite <br>
        space facts from this list!

      <p class="text">
        Without further ado, let’s launch right into these 15 crazy facts about space!
      </p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="fact">
      <h2  id="mercury" class="fact-title mercury-title">Mercury & Venus are the only 2 planets in <br> our solar system that have no
        moons.</h2>
      <img src="img/hwpage/1-mercury-venus-moonless.webp" alt="mercury" class="fact-img">
      <p class="text">In total, there are 176 confirmed moons that orbit the planets in our solar system, with <br> some
        of
        them being bigger than Mercury itself!</p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div class="fact">
      <h2 id="black-hole" class="fact-title">
        If a star passes too close to a black hole, it can <br> be torn apart.
      </h2>
      <img src="img/hwpage/2-star-passing-block-hole.webp" alt="star passing block hole" class="fact-img">
      <p class="text">
        For 20 years, a team of astronomers observed a star at the center of our galaxy <br> orbiting a black
        hole.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The star has now got close enough to the black hole for “gravitational redshift” to occur <br> which is
        where the star’s light loses energy as the black hole’s gravity intensified.
      </p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div class="fact">
      <h2 id="venus" class="fact-title venus-title">
        The hottest planet in our solar system is Venus.
      </h2>
      <img src="img/hwpage/3-venus-hottest-planet.webp" alt="venus planet" class="fact-img">
      <p class="text">
        Most people think that this would be Mercury, as it is the closest planet to the sun.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        However, Venus has a lot of gasses in its atmosphere which creates a “Greenhouse Effect” <br> that causes a
        constant
        temperature of 864° Fahrenheit (462° Celsius) everywhere on <br> the plant’s surface.
      </p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div id="solar-system" class="fact">
      <h2 class="fact-title">
        Our solar system is 4.57 billion years old.
      </h2>
      <img src="img/hwpage/4-solar-system-age.webp" alt="solar system" class="fact-img">
      <p class="text">
        Well, give or take 30 million years(ish). Accurately speaking, it is 4.571 billion years old.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Scientists estimate that in about 5 billion years, our Sun will expand becoming a Red Giant.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        In about 7.5 billion years its expanding surface will swallow up and engulf the Earth.
      </p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div id="enceladus" class="fact">
      <h2 class="fact-title">
        Enceladus, one of Saturn’s smaller moons, reflects <br> 90% of the Sun’s light.
      </h2>
      <img src="img/hwpage/5-enceladus-reflects-90-percent-light.webp" alt="Enceladus’ icy surface" class="fact-img">
      <p class="text">
        Because Enceladus’ icy surface reflects sunlight rather than absorbing it, temperatures <br> reach as low as
        -394°
        Fahrenheit (-201° Celsius).
      </p>

    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div id="mountain" class="fact">
      <h2 class="fact-title">
        The highest mountain discovered is the Olympus <br> Mons, which is located on Mars.
      </h2>

      <p class="text">
        Its peak is 16 miles (25 km) high, making it nearly 3 times higher than Mount Everest.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        And not only is it tall, but it’s also 374,015 ft² (114,000 m²) wide – that’s an area the size <br> of Arizona!
      </p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div id="m51" class="fact">
      <h2 class="fact-title">
        The Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) was the first celestial <br> object identified as being spiral.
      </h2>
      <img src="img/hwpage/7-whirlpool-galaxy-m51-spiral.webp" alt="whirlpool galaxy" class="fact-img">
      <p class="text">
        The grand, spiraling arms of the Whirlpool Galaxy are made up of long lanes of stars <br> and gas, sprinkled
        with
        lots of space dust.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        These arms act as star formation factories, compressing hydrogen gas and creating <br> clusters of new stars.
      </p>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div id="light-year" class="fact">
      <h2 class="fact-title">
        A light-year is the distance covered by light in a <br> single year.
      </h2>
      <img src="img/hwpage/8-what-is-a-lightyear.webp" alt="lightyear distance" class="fact-img">
      <p class="text">
        Light moves at the velocity of about 186,411 miles (300,000 km) a second.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        So one light-year equates to roughly 5,903,026,326,255 miles!

      <p class="text">
        It is about 109 times the diameter of Earth and is so large the Earth could fit inside the sun <br> about

      <p class="text">
        But wait a minute… if there’s no wind to blow them away then why is the flag blowing? <br> Well, it actually

      <p class="text">
        When sending droids to the surface of Mars, this is something scientists plan for, being <br> able to load the

    <div id="jupiter" class="fact">

        Jupiter is the planet in our solar system with the most moons, and it also has the largest <br> moon in our
        solar
        system.

      <p class="text">
        That moon is called Ganymede and is 33,279 miles (5,262 km) in diameter – that’s bigger <br> than Mercury and it

      <p class="text">
        So you’d therefore assume there are less days in a year on Mars than Earth, right? Wrong!
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Because Mars orbits the sun slower than the Earth, there are actually 687 Martian days <br> in a Martian year!
